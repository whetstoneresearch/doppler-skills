# Doppler Hooks

## When to use
- You need a top-level hook integration path for a price discovery launch
- You are using `DopplerHookInitializer` to register or manage hook callbacks
- You are troubleshooting hook-enabled multicurve pools and lifecycle transitions

## Prerequisites
- Asset/numeraire addresses and expected pool mode (locked vs migrable)
- Hook contract addresses and intended flags

## Core workflow
1. Initialize pool with `InitData` including optional `dopplerHook` and callback calldata.
2. Confirm stored state via `getState(asset)`:
   - pool key
   - far tick
   - status
   - selected hook
3. Validate callback execution path by flag:
   - `ON_INITIALIZATION_FLAG`
   - `ON_SWAP_FLAG`
   - `ON_GRADUATION_FLAG`
4. Verify graduation / migration behavior for the configured hook path.

## Supported hook modules
- Rehypothecation hook (`RehypeDopplerHook`) for buybacks and fee routing
- `ScheduledLaunchDopplerHook` for start-time gates
- `SwapRestrictorDopplerHook` for per-address amount ceilings

## Quick facts
| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Initializer contract | `DopplerHookInitializer` |
| Base hook contract | `BaseDopplerHook` |
| Core callback flags | `ON_INITIALIZATION_FLAG`, `ON_SWAP_FLAG`, `ON_GRADUATION_FLAG` |
| Common module | Rehypothecation hook (`RehypeDopplerHook`) |

## Failure modes
- Hook module not enabled for the target deployment
- Incorrect callback calldata encoding
- Status mismatch (`WrongPoolStatus` cases)
- Attempting migration without graduation conditions met
